Recently, the ideas behind “Digital Twin″ ({DT}) have been gaining ground in the {AECO} sector. This paper briefly reviews and analyzes relevant literature to discover the origins of the {DT} idea; crystallizes a clear definition; identifies {DT}’s key features; highlights some case studies carried out so far and outlines some of the key applications and the challenges for wider adoption.},

Incorporating {AI} with digital twin ({DT}) makes {DT} modelling flexible and accurate, while improving the learning efficiency of {AI} agents. In this chapter, we present the framework of {AI}-empowered {DT} and discuss some key issues in the joint application of these two technologies. Then, we introduce the incorporation paradigms of three {AI} learning approaches with {DT} networks.},

	abstract = {Systems do not simply pop into existence. They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with {NASA}’s current work with the Digital Twin.},

	abstract = {Modern aerospace industry is migrating from reactive to proactive and predictive maintenance to increase platform operational availability and efficiency, extend its useful life cycle and reduce its life cycle cost. Multiphysics modeling together with data-driven analytics generate a new paradigm called “Digital Twin.” The digital twin is actually a living model of the physical asset or system, which continually adapts to operational changes based on the collected online data and information, and can forecast the future of the corresponding physical counterpart. This paper reviews the overall framework to develop a digital twin coupled with the industrial Internet of Things technology to advance aerospace platforms autonomy. Data fusion techniques particularly play a significant role in the digital twin framework. The flow of information from raw data to high-level decision making is propelled by sensor-to-sensor, sensor-to-model, and model-to-model fusion. This paper further discusses and identifies the role of data fusion in the digital twin framework for aircraft predictive maintenance.},
