## Standard folder strucutre and files

### Source and renderred files

The source files (for editing) are Quarto-flavored markdown (`.qmd`) files. The text can be edited with any markdown editor, but to render good-looking presentations and documents, you need Quarto.

_If you render the source files in Quarto, they are exported to the `docs/` folder. These are not synchronised to GitHub. However, we place from time-to-time rendered version on the web, and at each milestone deposit an authoritative copy with DOI in the [Digital Music Observatory](https://zenodo.org/communities/music_observatory/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest) space on Zenodo._
